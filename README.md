hi
## How to work on this code:
- $ git clone \<url\>
- modify as you like
- $ git commit -a -m "\<your commit message\>"
- $ git push
### I haven't learned how pull requests work, which might be a much much much more reliable method...
## Special cases:
- When you want to undo "git add" and "git commit", bringing you to where you started off:
  - $ git reset HEAD~1
- When the remote repo is different and you want to overwrite that one with yours (be careful):
  - $ git push origin main --force
-
